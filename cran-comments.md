## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* reduced run time of code examples and tests
* added source info for included `groceryElog` dataset

Plus, I've bumped version number from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 to reflect above changes.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, devel R 3.4.0
* ubuntu 12.04, devel R 3.3.1 https://travis-ci.org/mplatzer/BTYDplus/builds/183631158 
* windows, R 3.3.2 https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mplatzer/btydplus/build/1.0.116 
* win-builder (devel R 3.4.0 and release R 3.3.2)
