Changes in version 0.4.0 (2015-01-15):

    o   renamed model from Pareto/CNBD to Pareto/GGG - function prefixes changed from 
        pcnbd to pggg accordingly

    o   cust-column is assigned as names to list of level_1 CODA-objects returned by 
        MCMC drawParameter methods - this makes it easier to access these via customer ID

    o   renamed to cbgcnbd.EstimateRegularity() to estimateRegularity(), because the 
        method is not bound to CBG/CNBD-k model - added tests and demo

Changes in version 0.3.3 (2015-01-15):

    o   added mc.cores parameter to MCMC methods to explicitely set number of parallel cores to be used

    o   important bug-fix for pcnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters - draw_tau slice-samples now from correct
        log_posterior in churn case

    o   more realistic test case for P/NBD MCMC, plus minor change to handling numeric underflow
        resulting in more accurate parameter estimates

    o   pcnbd.GenerateData now correctly considers fixed parameter value for k

    o   pcnbd.GenerateData has minimum level of 0.1 for generated k's in order to avoid itt's if 0

Changes in version 0.3.2 (2014-10-07):

    o   added mcmc.setBurnin method which cuts away (additional) initial burnin steps of MCMC chains

    o   *.EstimateParameters and *.mcmc.DrawParameters now also accept data.tables as input

    o   pcnbd.mcmc.plotRegularityRateHeterogeneity: add option to plot point estimates

    o   added mcmc.PActive and mcmc.plotPActiveDiagnostic

Changes in version 0.3.1 (2014-08-20):

    o   deprecated `abe.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` and `pcnbd.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions`
 in favor of newly added `mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` method

    o   deprecated `abe.mcmc.PAlive` and `pcnbd.mcmc.PAlive`
 in favor of newly added `mcmc.PAlive` method

    o   `*.mcmc.DrawParameters` now all consistenly return sampled `z` values
 in their output
